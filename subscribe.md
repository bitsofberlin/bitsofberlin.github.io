You can listen to this podcast on this website, but you might already use a
podcast client. If you do, you can simply press the subscribe button
above or copy the link to the <a href="http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:98241136/sounds.rss">feed</a>
and paste it into your app. And if you don't: consider installing one :wink: .
