### Adruino: Fun with electronics

On Saturday Dec 10th, we headed over to Prenzlauer Berg to the AllKnow Maker Store for the unveiling of their Arduino section. During the grand opening, we munched on pizza, added numerous items to our christmas lists, and chatted with store manager Michael Knieling, and CEO of Arduino, Federico Musto.

Take a listen to learn all about how arduino makes electronics fun and easy, its important open source community, and about the fantastic maker community that has brought arduino to Berlin.

Many thanks to [Mario](https://twitter.com/kidpixo) for alerting us to this great event!
