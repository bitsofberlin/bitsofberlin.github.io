## Arduino: Fun with electronics

On Saturday Dec 10th, we headed over to Prenzlauer Berg to the AllKnow Maker Store for the unveiling of their Arduino section. During the grand opening, we munched on pizza, added numerous items to our christmas lists, and chatted with store manager Michael Knieling, and CEO of Arduino, Federico Musto.

Take a listen to learn all about how arduino makes electronics fun and easy, its important open source community, and about the fantastic maker community that has brought arduino to Berlin.

For those of you new to Arduino, Arduino is an open-source computer hardware and software company, project and user community that designs and manufactures microcontroller-based kits for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control objects in the physical world.[1]
