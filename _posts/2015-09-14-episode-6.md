### Internet for everyone!

Have you ever checked your phone and noticed a freifunk wireless network? Have you ever connected to it and been pleasantly surprised that you were able to surf comfortably?

That's thanks to Berlin's Freifunk community, a non-commercial grassroots organization based on the idea that the internet should be free for all. Routers placed delicately on balconies, church towers, and anything high above the rooftops, connect to each other using mesh technology.

Not only is Freifunk great for the average user, it's also received lots of press due to the refugee movement. With the help of Freifunk, refugees entering the city of Berlin have been able to connect to their families and loved ones after a long trip to safety. 

In this episode we talk to Carsten about his love of Freifunk, and how it works.
