Can't wait for the next bits of berlin episode? We neither. But
to shorten your wait you could listen to the [official eurucamp
podcast](http://2014.eurucamp.org/). The eurucamp is a yearly
conference in Berlin for ruby developers. It's unique and inclusive
atmosphere makes it feel more like a happening than a conference.

The podcast was recorded during the eurucamp on the
last weekend and features talks with speakers, participants
and organizers of the conference. You will find a nice rant from
[Tom Stuart](https://twitter.com/tomstuart), a little bit of
coffee history by the nice folks from [the barn](http://barn.bigcartel.com)
and much more.

Give it a listen [here](http://2014.eurucamp.org/).
