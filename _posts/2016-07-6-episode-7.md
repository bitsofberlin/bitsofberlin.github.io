### A place for all the kickass tech ladies

Last summer at the Chaos Computer Camp, [Kat](http://twitter.com/kittycakejr)
and Marie met many wonderful women in tech who were doing exciting and
interesting things. Amazed, the two wondered to themselves, 'where have you all
been!?'

In response, [Heart of Code](http://heartofcode.org), a Berlin-based hackspace
for women, was created.  Yes, other hackspaces are open to women, but the two
founders discovered that when places are explicitely _for women_, women show
up. When they're not, chances of having a large female presence is often
smaller.

After less than a year, the group boasts a slack channel of over 400 members,
weekly meetups, and funding for workshops for teenagers. Kat and Marie are
proving that there are not only hundreds of eager & active tech ladies out
there, but also that this hidden community was just waiting for an opportunity
to support and frequent such a space.

In this episode we talk to [Heart of Code](https://twitter.com/heartsofcode)
founders Kat and Marie about their hackspace for women, why these types of
communities are important, and their hopes for the future.

**NOTE:** This episode was recorded at the beginning of June, so all dates
mentioned relate to June.
