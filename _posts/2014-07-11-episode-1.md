## Welcome to our first real episode!

In this episode we spoke with Rin RÃ¤uber, a real life cyborg! What makes one a
cyborg you might ask? Well, that's up for debate, but Rin has two magnets in
her hands (one in the fingertip of her ring finger and the other on the side of
her palm) and two RFID chips in her hands as well. Not only do they make for
awesome party tricks, but she has also used her implanted technology to turn on
her computer and open a safe full of candy.  Take a listen and hear how you too
can become a cyborg, or maybe just learn a little but about this growing and
incredibly interesting tech community.
