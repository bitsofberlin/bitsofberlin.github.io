## It's not just people that play football...

Robots do it too! In this episode we spoke with Lutz Freitag about the FUmanoids, the humanoid robots of the Freie Universitaet Berlin. Together with his team, Lutz builds and programs kid sized robots that compete in international robot football competitions. But as you'll soon hear, it's not really about football at all. Instead, Lutz and his colleages are working towards solving real world problems with robotics, and are eager to discover how humans really work and interact with their world.
