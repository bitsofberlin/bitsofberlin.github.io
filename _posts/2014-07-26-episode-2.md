## It's not just people that play football...

Robots do it too! In this episode we spoke with Lutz Freitag about the
FUmanoids, the humanoid robots of the Freie Universit√§t Berlin. Together with
his team, Lutz builds and programs kid sized robots that compete in
international robot football competitions. But as you'll soon hear, it's not
really about football at all. Instead, Lutz and his colleagues are working
towards solving real world problems with robotics, and are eager to discover
how humans really work and interact with their world.
